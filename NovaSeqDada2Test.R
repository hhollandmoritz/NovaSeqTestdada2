#' ## Create the NovaSeq-like reads
#' 
#' In NovaSeq phred scores are "binned" into 4 options. According to (this)[https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/appnotes/novaseq-hiseq-q30-app-note-770-2017-010.pdf] guide from Illumina, quality scores >30 are assigned 37, scores <15 are assigned 12, and scores between 15 and 30 are assigned a quality of 23. Any bases that cannot be called are assigned a score of 2. I have created a table of lookup codes for these conversions. The conversions don't include converting unassigned from 2s since the dada2 pipeline filters those out anyway. 

#' First we'll create a function to convert each line of scores to NovaSeq scores

# Read in the score translation table
QscoreTranslate <- read.csv("IlluminaQualityScores.csv", as.is = TRUE) # this table comes from Illumina's website, the last two columns have been added by me
head(QscoreTranslate)

                                     vectorize_all = FALSE)
  qualstr <- BString(novaqual) # convert back to BString
  return(qualstr)
}

#' ### 1. FILTER AND TRIM FOR QUALITY
#' 
#' Before chosing sequence variants, we want to trim reads where their quality scores begin to drop (the `truncLen` and `truncQ` values) and remove any low-quality reads that are left over after we have finished trimming (the `maxEE` value).
#' 
#' **You will want to change this depending on run chemistry and quality:** For 2x250 bp runs you can try ```truncLen=c(240,160)``` (as per the [dada2 tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html#inspect-read-quality-profiles)) if your reverse reads drop off in quality. Or you may want to choose a higher value, for example, ```truncLen=c(240,200)```, if they do not. In ```truncLen=c(xxx,yyy)```, ```xxx``` refers to the forward read truncation length, ```yyy``` refers to the reverse read truncation length.
#' 
#' **For ITS data:** Due to the expected variable read lengths in ITS data you should run this command without the ```trunclen``` parameter. See here for more information and appropriate parameters for ITS data: [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html).
#' 
#' *From dada2 tutorial:*
#' >If there is only one part of any amplicon bioinformatics workflow on which you spend time considering the parameters, it should be filtering! The parameters ... are not set in stone, and should be changed if they don’t work for your data. If too few reads are passing the filter, increase maxEE and/or reduce truncQ. If quality drops sharply at the end of your reads, reduce truncLen. If your reads are high quality and you want to reduce computation time in the sample inference step, reduce  maxEE. 
#' 
#' #### Inspect read quality profiles
#' It's important to get a feel for the quality of the data that we are using. To do this, we will plot the quality of some of the samples.
#' 
#' *From the dada2 tutorial:*
#' >In gray-scale is a heat map of the frequency of each quality score at each base position. The median quality score at each position is shown by the green line, and the quartiles of the quality score distribution by the orange lines. The red line shows the scaled proportion of reads that extend to at least that position (this is more useful for other sequencing technologies, as Illumina reads are typically all the same lenghth, hence the flat red line).

# If the number of samples is 20 or less, plot them all, otherwise, just plot 20 randomly selected samples

#' ### 2. INFER sequence variants
#' In this part of the pipeline dada2 will learn to distinguish error from biological 
#' differences using a subset of our data as a training set. After it understands the 
#' error rates, we will reduce the size of the dataset by combining all identical 
#' sequence reads into "unique sequences". Then, using the dereplicated data and 
#' error rates, dada2 will infer the sequence variants (OTUs) in our data. Finally, 
#' we will merge the coresponding forward and reverse reads to create a list of the 
#' fully denoised sequences and create a sequence table from the result.

#' #### Housekeeping step - set up and verify the file names for the output:
# File parsing
filtFs <- list.files(filtpathF, pattern="fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
filtRs <- list.files(filtpathR, pattern="fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)

# Sample names in order
sample.names <- substring(basename(filtFs), regexpr("_", basename(filtFs)) + 1) # doesn't drop fastq.gz
sample.names <- gsub(".fastq.gz", "", sample.names)
sample.namesR <- substring(basename(filtRs), regexpr("_", basename(filtRs)) + 1) # doesn't drop fastq.gz
sample.namesR <- gsub(".fastq.gz", "", sample.namesR)

# Double check
if(!identical(sample.names, sample.namesR)) stop("Forward and reverse files do not match.")
names(filtFs) <- sample.names
names(filtRs) <- sample.names

#' #### Learn the error rates
set.seed(100) # set seed to ensure that randomized steps are replicatable

# Learn forward error rates
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, nbases=1e8, multithread=TRUE)

# Learn reverse error rates
errR <- learnErrors(filtRs, nbases=1e8, multithread=TRUE)

#' #### Plot Error Rates
#' We want to make sure that the machine learning algorithm is learning the error rates properly. In the plots below, the red line represents what we should expect the learned error rates to look like for each of the 16 possible base transitions (A->A, A->C, A->G, etc.) and the black line and grey dots represent what the observed error rates are. If the black line and the red lines are very far off from each other, it may be a good idea to increase the ```nbases``` parameter. This alows the machine learning algorthim to train on a larger portion of your data and may help imporve the fit.

#' ### 3. REMOVE Chimeras and ASSIGN Taxonomy
#' Although dada2 has searched for indel errors and subsitutions, there may still be chimeric
#' sequences in our dataset (sequences that are derived from forward and reverse sequences from 
#' two different organisms becoming fused together during PCR and/or sequencing). To identify 
#' chimeras, we will search for rare sequence variants that can be reconstructed by combining
#' left-hand and right-hand segments from two more abundant "parent" sequences. After removing chimeras, we will use a taxonomy database to train a classifer-algorithm
#' to assign names to our sequence variants.
#' 
#' For the tutorial 16S, we will assign taxonomy with Silva db v132, but you might want to use other databases for your data. Below are paths to some of the databases we use often. (If you are on your own computer you can download the database you need from this link [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html):)
#' 
#'   - 16S bacteria and archaea (SILVA db): /db_files/dada2/silva_nr_v132_train_set.fa
#' 
#'   - ITS fungi (UNITE db): /db_files/dada2/sh_general_release_dynamic_02.02.2019.fasta
#' 
#'   - 18S protists (PR2 db): /db_files/dada2/pr2_version_4.11.1_dada2.fasta
#' 

# Read in RDS 
st.all <- readRDS(paste0(table.fp, "/seqtab.rds"))

# Remove chimeras
seqtab.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(st.all, method="consensus", multithread=TRUE)

# Print percentage of our seqences that were not chimeric.
100*sum(seqtab.nochim)/sum(seqtab)

# Assign taxonomy
tax <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, "/db_files/dada2/silva_nr_v132_train_set.fa", tryRC = TRUE,
                      multithread=TRUE)

# Write results to disk
saveRDS(seqtab.nochim, paste0(table.fp, "/seqtab_final.rds"))
saveRDS(tax, paste0(table.fp, "/tax_final.rds"))

#' ### 4. Optional - FORMAT OUTPUT to obtain ASV IDs and repset, and input for mctoolsr
#' For convenience sake, we will now rename our ASVs with numbers, output our 
#' results as a traditional taxa table, and create a matrix with the representative
#' sequences for each ASV. 

# Flip table
seqtab.t <- as.data.frame(t(seqtab.nochim))

# Pull out ASV repset
rep_set_ASVs <- as.data.frame(rownames(seqtab.t))
rep_set_ASVs <- mutate(rep_set_ASVs, ASV_ID = 1:n())
rep_set_ASVs$ASV_ID <- sub("^", "ASV_", rep_set_ASVs$ASV_ID)
rep_set_ASVs$ASV <- rep_set_ASVs$`rownames(seqtab.t)` 
rep_set_ASVs$`rownames(seqtab.t)` <- NULL

# Add ASV numbers to table
rownames(seqtab.t) <- rep_set_ASVs$ASV_ID

# Add ASV numbers to taxonomy
taxonomy <- as.data.frame(tax)
taxonomy$ASV <- as.factor(rownames(taxonomy))
taxonomy <- merge(rep_set_ASVs, taxonomy, by = "ASV")
rownames(taxonomy) <- taxonomy$ASV_ID
taxonomy_for_mctoolsr <- unite_(taxonomy, "taxonomy", 
                                c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order","Family", "Genus", "ASV_ID"),
                                sep = ";")

# Write repset to fasta file
# create a function that writes fasta sequences
writeRepSetFasta<-function(data, filename){
  fastaLines = c()
  for (rowNum in 1:nrow(data)){
    fastaLines = c(fastaLines, as.character(paste(">", data[rowNum,"name"], sep = "")))
    fastaLines = c(fastaLines,as.character(data[rowNum,"seq"]))
  }
  fileConn<-file(filename)
  writeLines(fastaLines, fileConn)

}

#' ### Summary of output files:
#' 1. seqtab_final.txt - A tab-delimited sequence-by-sample (i.e. OTU) table 
#' 2. tax_final.txt - a tab-demilimited file showing the relationship between ASVs, ASV IDs, and their taxonomy 
#' 3. seqtab_wTax_mctoolsr.txt - a tab-delimited file with ASVs as rows, samples as columns and the final column showing the taxonomy of the ASV ID 
#' 4. repset.fasta - a fasta file with the representative sequence of each ASV. Fasta headers are the ASV ID and taxonomy string.  
#'
#'
#' ### 5. Summary of reads throughout pipeline
#' Here we track the reads throughout the pipeline to see if any step is resulting in a greater-than-expected loss of reads. If a step is showing a greater than expected loss of reads, it is a good idea to go back to that step and troubleshoot why reads are dropping out. The dada2 tutorial has more details about what can be changed at each step.

#' ## Final Steps
#' You can now transfer over the output files onto your local computer. 
#' The table and taxonomy can be read into R with 'mctoolsr' package as below. 

#+ downstream options 1, eval = FALSE, include=TRUE
tax_table_fp = 'mypath/seqtab_wTax_mctoolsr.txt'
map_fp = 'mypath/my_mapfile.txt' 
input = load_taxa_table(tax_table_fp, map_fp)

#' ### Post-pipeline considerations
#' After following this pipline, you will need to think about the following in downstream applications (example with 'mctoolsr' R package below):
#' 
#' 1. Remove mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences
#' 2. Remove reads assigned as eukaryotes
#' 3. Remove reads that are unassigned at domain level

#+ downstream options 2, eval = FALSE, include=TRUE
input_filt <- filter_taxa_from_input(input, taxa_to_remove = c("Chloroplast","Mitochondria", "Eukaryota"))
input_filt <- filter_taxa_from_input(input_filt, at_spec_level = 2, taxa_to_remove = "NA")

#' 4. Normalize or rarefy your ASV table

#+ downstream options 3, eval = FALSE, include=TRUE
input_filt <- single_rarefy(input = input_filt, depth = 5000) # CHANGE ME to desired depth.
